Today’s computer users rarely run just one program. From browsing in Chrome or
gaming in CS:GO and streaming music on Spotify, multitasking is the norm. To
support this, the system creates the illusion of multiple CPUs — a concept known
as CPU virtualization. This is achieved through a technique called
[time-sharing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/time-sharing-operating-system/),
where the CPU rapidly switches between tasks to give each the appearance of
running simultaneously. Each of these running programs is known as a process.
