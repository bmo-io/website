**TODO: ADD Refrence to correct section on each**

This subsection is based on
[Operating System](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) book.

We'll start from a basic question, **What is Operating System?** A program that
ensures the computer system operates correctly and efficiently while providing
an easy-to-use interface for users.

The Operating System achieves its goals through several key
techniques,including:

- [virtualization](---), which abstracts hardware resources.
- [system calls](---), an APIs which provide a controlled interface for programs
  to interact with the system.
- [resource management](---), which ensures efficient and fair allocation of
  CPU, memory, storage, and other resources.

These techniques build **abstractions** that make the system more convenient and
easier to use. Furthermore, an Operating System must deliver high performance by
minimizing overhead, all while ensuring strong isolation and protection between
concurrently running applications.
